# use-of-visible_if-in-shopify-schema
Visuble_if is the latest shopify schema update 
In Shopify's schema for sections, the visible_if property allows developers to conditionally control the visibility of settings within the Theme Editor. This means a setting can be hidden or shown based on other settings' values, streamlining the user experience and preventing errors. For example, a setting related to a button's link can only be visible if another setting related to a button is enabled.
